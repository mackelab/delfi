``distribution`` â€“ Distributions
--------------------------------

Several probability distributions are implemented in the module ``delfi.distribution``.

The general interface for distributions is specified in the abstract class
``BaseDistribution.py``: Each distribution needs to implement the abstract
methods  and properties of this class. Mixture distributions and the respective base class are in the module ``delfi.distribution.mixture``.

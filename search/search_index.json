The focus of delfi is Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE). In SNPE, a neural network is trained to perform Bayesian inference on simulated data. To see illustrations of SNPE on canonical problems in neuroscience, read our preprint: Training deep neural density estimators to identify mechanistic models of neural dynamics . To get started quickly, refer to the installation instructions and tutorials . More in-depth tutorials will be added soon. To learn more about the general motivation behind simulation-based inference, and algorithms included in delfi , keep on reading. Motivation and approach \u00b6 Many areas of science and engineering make extensive use of complex, stochastic, numerical simulations to describe the structure and dynamics of the processes being investigated. A key challenge in simulation-based science is linking simulation models to empirical data: Bayesian inference provides a general and powerful framework for identifying the set of parameters which are consistent both with empirical data and prior knowledge. One of the key quantities required for statistical inference, the likelihood of observed data given parameters, \\(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = p(x_o|\\theta)\\) , is typically intractable for simulation-based models, rendering conventional statistical approaches inapplicable. Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) is a powerful machine-learning technique to address this problem. Goal: Algorithmically identify mechanistic models which are consistent with data. SNPE takes three inputs: A candidate mechanistic model, prior knowledge or constraints on model parameters, and data (or summary statistics). SNPE proceeds by: sampling parameters from the prior and simulating synthetic datasets from these parameters, and using a deep density estimation neural network to learn the (probabilistic) association between data (or data features) and underlying parameters, i.e. to learn statistical inference from simulated data. This density estimation network is then applied to empirical data to derive the full space of parameters consistent with the data and the prior, i.e. the posterior distribution. High posterior probability is assigned to parameters which are consistent with both the data and the prior, low probability to inconsistent parameters. If needed, an initial estimate of the posterior can be used to adaptively generate additional informative simulations. Publications \u00b6 Algorithms included in delfi were published in the following papers, which provide additional information: Fast \u03b5-free Inference of Simulation Models with Bayesian Conditional Density Estimation by Papamakarios & Murray (NeurIPS 2016) [PDF] [BibTeX] Flexible statistical inference for mechanistic models of neural dynamics by Lueckmann, Goncalves, Bassetto, \u00d6cal, Nonnenmacher & Macke (NeurIPS 2017) [PDF] [BibTeX] Automatic posterior transformation for likelihood-free inference by Greenberg, Nonnenmacher & Macke (ICML 2019) [PDF] [BibTeX] We refer to these algorithms as SNPE-A, SNPE-B, and SNPE-C/APT, respectively. As an alternative to directly estimating the posterior on parameters given data, it is also possible to estimate the likelihood of data given parameters, and then subsequently draw posterior samples using MCMC ( Papamakarios, Sterratt & Murray, 2019 1 , Lueckmann, Karaletsos, Bassetto, Macke, 2019 ). Depending on the problem, approximating the likelihood can be more or less effective than SNPE techniques. See Cranmer, Brehmer, Louppe (2019) for a recent review on simulation-based inference and our recent preprint Training deep neural density estimators to identify mechanistic models of neural dynamics (Goncalves et al., 2019) for applications to canonical problems in neuroscience.

Simulator \u00b6 For the purpose of this example, we will consider a very simple statistical model, with a single parameter \\(\\theta\\) . Depending on \\(\\theta\\) , data is generated according to: \\(x|\\mathbf{\\theta} \\sim 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(x|\\mu=\\theta, \\sigma^2=1) + 0.5 \\mathcal{N}(x|\\mu=\\theta, \\sigma^2=0.1)\\) This model is implemented in delfi.simulator , we will import the model and create an instance: from delfi.simulator import GaussMixture n_params = 1 m = GaussMixture ( dim = n_params ) Prior \u00b6 Next, we will define a prior distribution over \\(\\theta\\) as \\(\\mathcal{U}(-10, 10)\\) : import delfi.distribution as dd import numpy as np p = dd . Uniform ( lower = [ - 10 ], upper = [ 10 ]) Summary statistics \u00b6 We will not reduce the dimensionality of our data, and instead just apply the identity: from delfi.summarystats import Identity s = Identity () Generator \u00b6 Having defined the simulator, prior, and summary statistics, we instantiate a generator object: from delfi.generator import Default g = Default ( model = m , prior = p , summary = s ) Having specified the generator, we can draw parameters and data using the gen() method: params , stats = g . gen ( 500 ) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline plt . plot ( stats , params , '.' ) plt . ylabel ( r '$\\theta$' ) plt . xlabel ( r 'x' ); Inference \u00b6 Say, we observed data \\(x_\\text{o}\\) and are interested in the posterior distribution \\(p(\\theta|x=x_\\text{o})\\) . The likelihood-free inference (LFI) algorithms implemented in delfi allow doing so, without using the likelihood function: In most real world application, the likelihood function is not available. We aim to do inference by just generating examples, i.e., simulating the model. We choose the toy model such that the posterior is easily tractable analytically. This will allow us to judge the result against the ground truth. We will carry out inference for \\(x_0 = 0\\) . x0 = np . array ([[ 0. ]]) Basic density estimation based LFI \u00b6 A simple algorithm to use density estimation for LFI looks as follows: \\(q_\\phi\\) will be a mixture density network (MDN): The MDN is a neural network that maps from \\(x\\) to a Gaussian mixture distribution. For our example, we will set \\(K=2\\) , such that the resulting mixtures will have two components. To apply the above algorithm to the toy problem, create an instance of the inference algorithm specifying details: %% capture from delfi.inference import Basic inf_basic = Basic ( obs = x0 , generator = g , n_components = 2 , n_hiddens = [ 10 ]) We specified that we want K=2 components, and the neural network got a single hidden layer with 10 units. Additional entries in the list passed for n_hiddens would create additional layers. log , train_data , _ = inf_basic . run ( n_train = 4000 ) We drew N=n_train training examples and ran the algorithm. We can plot the loss function, across training rounds of the neural network: plt . figure () for i in range ( len ( log )): plt . subplot ( 1 , len ( log ), i + 1 ) plt . plot ( log [ i ][ 'loss' ]) plt . xlabel ( 'Iteration' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Loss' ) plt . title ( 'Round {0}' . format ( i + 1 )) Say we observed \\(x_o = 0.\\) and want to predict the posterior \\(\\hat{p}(\\theta | x=x_{\\text{o}})\\) : posterior = inf_basic . predict ( x0 ) The parameters of the predicted posterior are: for k in range ( 2 ): print ( r 'component {}: mixture weight = {:.2f}; mean = {:.2f}; variance = {:.2f}' . format ( k + 1 , posterior . a [ k ], posterior . xs [ k ] . m [ 0 ], posterior . xs [ k ] .

More complicated problems, however, may require more sophisticated algorithms. Instead of sampling all parameters from the prior, we can use our simulator more efficiently by drawin only a first sent of parameters from the prior and then switch to using a different distribution to sample from (a proposal distribution). Intuitively, the proposal distribution is chosen such that, when simulated, data is closer to \\(x_o\\) . In order to get the correct posterior, we will need to account for the fact that we drew these samples from a different distribution. There are three inference methods impelemented in delfi, each with a different approaches to this problem. APT or SNPE-C is the latest version of the SNPE algorithm and performs best on most problems. Automatic posterior transformation \u00b6 Automatic posterior transformation (APT, sometimes referred to as SNPE-C) improves on SNPE-A and SNPE-B by adjusting for the difference between the proposal and prior during learing. This means that APT doesn\u2019t rely on post-hoc corrections or importance weights, which leads to more accurate inference than the previous two methods. This technique is described in \u201cAutomatic Posterior Transformation for Likelihood-Free Inference,\u201d by Greenberg, Nonnenmacher and Macke, ICML 2019. from delfi.inference import APT inf_APT = APT ( generator = g , n_components = 2 , n_hiddens = [ 10 ], obs = x0 ) logs , tds , posteriors = inf_APT . run ( n_train = [ 3000 , 1000 ], n_rounds = 2 , train_on_all = True ) posterior = posteriors [ - 1 ] for k in range ( 2 ): print ( r 'component {}: mixture weight = {:.2f}; mean = {:.2f}; variance = {:.2f}' . format ( k + 1 , posterior . a [ k ], posterior . xs [ k ] . m [ 0 ], posterior . xs [ k ] .

Simulators should inherit from a simulator base class. The base class for simulators specifies that each child needs to inherit a method called gen_single() \u2013 the function that forward simulates a single \\(\\theta\\) to data. It should return a dictionary that contains the result under a key called data . This is also detailled in the docstring of the base class . For an actual implementation, you can see the code for the mixture model we used above: https://github.com/mackelab/delfi/blob/master/delfi/simulator/GaussMixture.py . For this example, we used the identity as a summary statistics. If you were to use summary statistics, consider the implementation of mean summary statistics for a basic example: https://github.com/mackelab/delfi/blob/master/delfi/summarystats/Mean.py , and again, there is a base class specifying the interface .","title":"Quickstart"},{"location":"tutorials/quickstart/#getting-started","text":"In this tutorial, we will do parameter inference on a simple statistical model.

More complicated problems, however, may require more sophisticated algorithms. Instead of sampling all parameters from the prior, we can use our simulator more efficiently by drawin only a first sent of parameters from the prior and then switch to using a different distribution to sample from (a proposal distribution). Intuitively, the proposal distribution is chosen such that, when simulated, data is closer to \\(x_o\\) . In order to get the correct posterior, we will need to account for the fact that we drew these samples from a different distribution.
